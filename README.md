# The Health Impact of Air Pollution in the U.S.

### **Project Overview**  
This project investigates how air pollution impacts respiratory health in U.S. cities, focusing on trends over time and geographic differences. Using data from the **EPA Air Quality System (AQS)** and **CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network**, this project aims to identify the most affected regions and explore how changes in air quality correlate with respiratory health outcomes.

### **Essential Question**  
**"Is there a correlation between diminished air quality and respiratory illness rates across U.S. urban areas?"**  

---

### **Data Sources**  
- **EPA Air Quality System (AQS)** – [Annual AQI and Pollutant Data (PM2.5, Ozone)](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) (CSV)  
- **CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network** – [Respiratory Illness and Hospitalization Rates](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/) (JSON)

### **Potential Visualizations**  
1. **Choropleth Map:**  
   - To highlight U.S. cities with high air pollution and respiratory health impacts.  
2. **Time-Series Graph:**  
   - To track air pollution levels and respiratory illness trends from 2000 to 2025.  
3. **Scatter Plot:**  
   - To visualize the relationship between air quality (PM2.5 levels) and respiratory illness rates.

### **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to provide an insightful analysis of air quality and its health impact in the U.S., using interactive visualizations to reveal patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.
